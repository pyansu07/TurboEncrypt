## Idea:

- Divides the file into different small-small parts, encrypts each part at same time (kind of parallel circuits/methods) and then combines the encrypted part into a single file.

- Use of some standard encryption method.

## Advantages:

- Increased Speed and Efficiency.
- Scalability
- Better Performance for Large Files
- Increased Data Security
